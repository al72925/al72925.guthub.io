    <h3 Style= "text-align:center">Prologue- The Eternal War</h3>
            
<div>

<p>In the vast starry skies, on a blood-soaked planet in a far off galaxy, the Eternal War of humanity against the Solaires continue.</p>
<p>"Charge! Charge! For your World!"</p>
<p>"Charge! Charge! For your Family!"</p>
<p>"Charge! Charge you Bastards! For your Lives!"</p>
<P>I'm desperately screaming at my soldiers as they rush head first towards the burning frontline, meteors and fireballs exploding all around us, casting the land in a fiery-red glow. My soldiers dash ahead, casting phantom shields and firing blazing spells back towards those monsters. The stone abominations return fire as they cast deadly spells of their own, the counter attack killing thousands at once. New reinforcements continue to pour out of the teleportation arrays as the Battle of Argon continues on for the eighteenth year.</P>
    <P>As I begin to cast spells of my own, seven dark red magic circles around me blaze into life, draining the ambient mana surrounding me like seven vast whirlpools. Earth, fire, and air elements are drawn from the Elemental Planes, constructing the seventh circle spell Blazing Meteor. Just as the meteor, shaped like a skyscraper sized bullet, form, the air elements shoots the million ton rock at supersonic speeds towards one of the mage battalions in the rear of the opposing army. </P>
    <P>The mages in question first tries to shoot down the massive projective, then failing that, tries to cast the seventh circle spell Fortress Wall. Just before its completion, however, the meteor suddenly speeds up as a second burst of air elements hidden behind the meteor shoots it to near lightning speed. Breaking through the magic circle, the meteor strikes the defenseless mages, disintegrating the stone monsters into particles.</P>
    <P>Taking a short moment to rest as the circles around my heart slow to a near stop, I quickly enter a Humvee and return to the forward base. Standing on the teleportation array with the sick and wounded, I prepare myself as the world around me distort then shatter like glass as we begin to pierce through space.</P>
    <P>For a moment, I felt a sense of zero gravity as everything around me turn into the darkest of blacks. Then gravity, along with color, returns and hits me like a sledge hammer to the stomach.</P>
    <P>Quickly calming down my nausea, I ignore the healers bringing the soldiers away as I hurry towards the nearby blast room. I enter the room, barely the size of an airplane lavatory, and rapidly lock the door. Looking around and locating the iris scanner, I lock eyes. After a moment, the machine confirms my identity and the wall to my left disappears.</P>
    <P>Behind the missing wall, a small 50 ml pure glass bottle rests on a shock proof shelf. Inside the bottle is a sickly black liquid, just the sight of which causes my suppressed nausea to flare back up. I carefully picked up the bottle and slowly drank the foul liquid, afraid that the slightest of shock will cause the volatile liquid to explode. Many men had already suffered such deaths.</P>

<P>As I worry over my potential death, my exhausted circles start rotating again, faster and faster till my conscience can no longer see the runes etched on them. As they spin, mana start gathering in me again as my body automatically draws them in.</P>

<P>Although slightly sick, I still returned to the teleportation array. All around me, soldiers dressed in sleek black metallic exoskeletons salute towards me and then readied themselves for the teleportation. I too, dressed in my bulky red and gold striped armor prepared. This time, with the aid of the mana inside of me, I was able to stabilize myself and prevent another onset of nausea.</P>

    <P>Just as I locate the vehicle and prepare to return to the frontline, an earthquake strikes.</P>

<P>A sudden earthquake causes me to stumble, a sudden chill across my back as I felt a horrible premonition.</P>

<P>"The left wing is breaking!, The left wing is breaking! All soldiers retreat! All soldiers retreat!! Brigadier General Madison, guard the retreat!"</P>

<P>As I listen to the Supreme Commander over the radio, I know that my death is coming. It is an unofficial law that all losing generals will face the death penalty in the military court. So it is  common practice for losing commanders to die fighting the Solaires than to be sentenced to death.</P>

<P>I hand over my wedding ring to my aid and began casting the strongest spell of my entire life. Seven dark red magic circles spring to life around me as the seven circles in my heart start revolving.</P>

<P>I take out a pendant out of my pocket and gaze at my family in the photo. Fourteen children huddled around my wife and I, with the fifteenth starting to show on her stomach. I smile as I stare at my beautiful wife's face, wishing my family farewell and kissing them one last time.</P>

    <P style="font-size:200%">Then I started to burn.</P>

<P>The first to burn are the seven circles around my heart. An extraordinary pain appears, then disappear, as the numbing magic takes effect. As by circles that I spent decades to create are destroyed, an eighth magic circle, larger than the others and bright red in color, forms.</P>

<P>The second to combust is my body. My fourth-five-year-old body simultaneously combusts, flesh and blood burned, then the bones darken and turn into ask. I lost my ability to see, but I'm sure that an ninth, blood red magic circle has appeared.</P>

<P>The last to combust is my soul. A soul tearing pain that refuses to stop no matter how hard I try to stop the technique blazes through the very core of my being. I scream at my enemies, I scream at my world, I scream at the scientists that never told us about the pain. I screamed, then I begged, then I whimpered, then I died.</P>

    <div><br></div>
<P>Above where the being known as Arnold Madison used to exist, a gigantic black magic circle surrounded by nine others was created. An enormous amount of mana gathered at the spell while the Solairs stopped their assault. By gathering all of the mana in a formation, they were able to form a tenth circle Absolute Guard spell right before a beam of solar fire struck.</P>

<P>It took ten seconds for the Apocalypse Fire spell to end, and another hour for the temperature surrounding the Absolute Guard to return to bearable conditions. With surrounding hundreds of kilometers  melted from the tens of thousands degree temperature of the solar flare, the Solairs set out to test if the world was still livable and wither they could colonize it.</P>

<P>The human soldiers meanwhile managed to retreat with teleportation arrays and returned to Earth. The name Arnold Madison, along with others, will be used by propagandist for further support of the war.</P>

<P>However, that did not matter to General Madison as his soul, utterly destroyed, returned to the river of souls.</P>
